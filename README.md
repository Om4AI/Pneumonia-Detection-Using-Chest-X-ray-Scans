# Pneumonia-Detection-Using-Chest-X-ray-Scans By Team Endurance

## Abstract

The risk of pneumonia is immense for many, especially in developing nations where billions face energy poverty and rely on polluting forms of energy. The WHO estimates that over 4 million premature deaths occur annually from household air pollution-related diseases including pneumonia. Over 150 million people get infected with pneumonia on an annual basis especially children under 5 years old.

## Objectives:

### The HealthCare Challenge?
Build an algorithm using AI/ML models to automatically identify whether a patient is suffering from pneumonia or not by looking at chest X-ray images.

We aim at creating a model for scanning **Chest x-ray images** and classifying as Pneumoniatic / Normal x-rays. The model has been developed using **TensorFlow and Keras** using Transfer Learning using **VGG19**. 

### Concepts: 
1. Convolutional Neural Networks
2. Transfer Learning
3. Early stopping (to avoid overfitting) 
4. Callbacks

### Environment & Tools: 
1. TensorFlow
2. Keras
3. Pandas
4. Numpy
5. Matplotlib
6. Kaggle API
7. Flask

### Pretrained Model:
#### VGG19 trained on ImageNet dataset
