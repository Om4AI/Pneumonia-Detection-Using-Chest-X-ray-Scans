# Pneumonia-Detection-Using-Chest-X-ray-Scans By Team Endurance

The risk of pneumonia is immense for many, especially in developing nations where billions face energy poverty and rely on polluting forms of energy. The WHO estimates that over 4 million premature deaths occur annually from household air pollution-related diseases including pneumonia. Over 150 million people get infected with pneumonia on an annual basis especially children under 5 years old.

## The HealthCare Challenge?
Build an algorithm using AI/ML models to automatically identify whether a patient is suffering from pneumonia or not by looking at chest X-ray images. 



We aim at creating a model for scanning **Chest x-ray images** and classifying as Pneumoniatic / Normal x-rays. The model has been developed using **TensorFlow and Keras** using Transfer Learning using VGG19. 

Concepts:
1. Transfer Learning
2. Early stopping (to avoid overfitting) 



The model will also be deployed to a local host server using Flask for further use.
